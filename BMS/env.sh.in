# This file is used to set up ones environment to use this JANA installation
# when running bash. It is generated automatically when JANA is
# configured and installed during the install phase. To use it, do this:
#
# . /path/to/JANA/setenv.sh
#
# This sets environment variables for some other packages for which
# support was compiled into this version of JANA. Usually, you will
# need to use the same versions of these packages, hence their inclusion
# here. If you do not want those variables to be set here, then you can
# disable it by setting the JANAONLY environment variable.

# (DY)LD_LIBRARY_PATH
# On BSD systems, DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH is used while on most others
# (including Linux) LD_LIBRARY_PATH is used. To accomodate both styles,
# we put everything in a local LIBRARY_PATH variable and then
# add that to the appropriate variable at the end of the script.
# We initialize the LIBRARY_PATH with the JANA lib directory
