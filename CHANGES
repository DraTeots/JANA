Changes in version 0.4.3

- Added CHANGES file
- Added autoconf to build system:
	= Optionally include MySQL as well as XERCES using autoconf
	= XERCES conditional compiles now based on HAVE_XERCES value
- Fixed name of TestSpeed plugin (there was a typo in the name "TerstSpeed.so")
- Added optional filter argument to GetXPaths method of JGeometry class
- Added code that decided whether to make a JGeometryXML or a JGeometryMYSQL
  object based on the JANA_GEOMETRY_URL value. This probably needs to be redone
  with a generator mechanism in order to make it extensible.
- Added JGeometryMYSQL class. Class is just a place holder and not yet implemented
