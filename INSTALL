Quick Start
--------------------
> tar xzvf jana_0.7.0.tgz
> cd jana_0.7.0
> scons install

- To build with multiple threads, add "-jX" to the scons command
where "X" is the number of threads.

- The old make system is no longer supported. Try it at your own risk.


Obtaining the Source
--------------------
The source may be obtained as a tarball from the JANA website at:

http://www.jlab.org/JANA/downloads.php

The stable versions are numbered while the "jana_svn_daily_linux.tgz"
file is regenerated from the repository nightly and should be 
considered unstable.

Unpack the tarball containing the source. For example:

>tar xzf path-to-tarball/jana_0.7.0.tgz


Configuring
------------------------------------------------
Configuration is now done during the scons build phase and
is driven by the presence and values of environment varibles
only. If you wish to build without support for a certain
package, just make sure the associated environment variable
is not set.



Building and Installing
---------------------------------------
To build JANA and install it, just run "scons install" 

>scons install

...to build with 32 simultaneous threads...

>scons -j32 install

The binaries and headers will be installed in a directory 
parallel to src with a name based on the BM_OSNAME environment
variable setting. Two environment setup scripts are generated
during the build in the installation directory. One for (t)csh
and the other for bash. Source the appropriate one to setup
your environment to use the installed JANA versions.


NOTE: If you have trouble with xerces related items during
the build, make sure your XERCESCROOT environment variable
is set to point to an appropriate installation of xerces-c.
This whould work with xerces 2.7, and 2.8, but version 3 or
higher is recommended.


Using JANA
---------------------------------------
JANA is primarily a library so you will most likely be writing
a program that links to it. It is recommended that you set
the JANA_HOME environment variable to point to the installation
directory and then use that to source the appropriate setenv.csh
script therein. A program "jana-config" exists to help build
compile and link commands for using the specific JANA installation
as it may or may not include support for various 3rd party
packages.
