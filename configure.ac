# autoconf configuration file for JANA
#
# To re-generate the configue script, run the "reconf" script in this
# directory (note, you probably DON'T need to regenerate configure!)
#
# JANA uses its own make system (BMS) and so does not make use
# of the automake tool. It does however use the autoconf tool
# to generate the file jana_config.h. This is included by other
# files in JANA to conditionally compile sections of code that
# use optional packages such as xerces and mysql.
#
# Most of the macros used here were downloaded and are marked
# with the URL from which they were retrieved.
