Installation instructions for JANA
6/5/2008 David Lawrence

Obtaining the Source
--------------------
The source may be obtained as a tarball from the JANA website at:

http://www.jlab.org/JANA/downloads.php

The stable versions are numbered while the "jana_svn_daily_linux.tgz"
file is regenerated from the repository nightly and should be 
considered unstable.

JANA may be installed in a system directory such as /usr/local or
one may choose to install it in its own directory located in a
private area. If you plan to install to a private area, you should
make that directory now and unpack the jana source into it. If
you plan to install to a different loctation than where the source
is, you can unpack it anywhere. For example:

>mkdir ~/JANA
>cd ~/JANA
>tar xzf path-to-tarball/jana_0.4.5.tgz


Configuring
------------------------------------------------
Before building, you must first configure JANA for your system.
This is done using the included configure script inside the src
directory. Change to the src directory and run configure.
For example:

>cd src
>./configure


Running configure with no options will cause the executables,
libraries, and header files to be installed in directories
parallel to the src directory (assuming you run configure
from within the src directory). If you wish to install to
a different location, this can be specified with the --prefix
(or --exec_prefix) argument. For example:

>./configure --prefix=/usr/local

Note that JANA can optionally compile in support for some
external packages such as the Xerces XML parser or MySQL.
The command line arguments specific to these can be found
by running configure with the -h argument. As an example,
suppose Xerces is installed in a directory pointed to by
the XERCESCROOT environment variable. One can then do the
following:

>./configure --with-xerces=$XERCESCROOT


Building and Installing
---------------------------------------
To build JANA and install it, just run "make" in the src directory.

>make

The binaries and headers will be installed in the directories 
parallel to src or in an alternate directory as described above.

You can test that the build succeeded by running one of the utility
programs. For example, the "jana" utility:

>cd ../bin
>./jana --janaversion


Using JANA
---------------------------------------
JANA is primarily a library so you will most likely be writing
a program that links to it. It is recommended that you set
the JANA_HOME environment variable to point to the installation
directory and then use that in your program's build system.
Also, be sure to add the installation directory+/bin to your PATH if
it is not already there so as to have access to the utilty programs.
