README for jcalibws

Jan. 12, 2009  David Lawrence

This plugin implements a client-side mechanism to access a calibration and
conditions database using a web-service and the JANA API. In other words,
this allows calibration constants to be obtained through a Web Service.

Specifically, this will register a JCalibrationGenerator that will be used
to make a JCalibration object if the JANA_CALIB_URL is set to have the form:

http://*/jcalibws

Requests for contants will be sent to the Web Service and the response 
passed back to the caller.

The underlying mechanism is the gSOAP package for implemeting SOAP web
services using C++.
