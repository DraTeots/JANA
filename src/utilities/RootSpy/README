README for RootSpy

This program can be used in conjunction with the rootspy plugin to
allow retrieval and display of histograms from a running processing
via the cMsg messaging system. The cMsg package must be installed 
for this to build (currently at cMsg-3.0) and the CMSGROOT environment
variable set as well as the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

The rootspy plugin must be attached to the histogram producing object
when it is started. The RootSpy program and the histogram producer(s)
can be started in any order.

This system is distributed as part of JANA, but does not actually
use JANA itself aside from the InitPlugin(JApplication *japp)
format of the trivial routine used as the plugin entry point.

One could simply delete that routine, compile the plugin as a 
reqular library, and simply create a DRootSpy object to get the
same functionality without requiring JANA at all.
